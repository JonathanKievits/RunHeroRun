# RunHeroRun

Run Hero Run is an Android game made for an exam project.

Thanks to this [API](https://github.com/olokobayusuf/Pedometer-API) for making it possible to work with a pedometer in unity.

The game project itself feels incomplete but I personally hit all my goals in this short period and I got to try out a lot of new things since I never really worked on making an app before nor making usage of an API and try to work with it.
